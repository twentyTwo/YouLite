# YouLite
An attempt at a lightweight youtube browser. For now has simple GUI, systematics and no setup instructions. Sorry.

#What is YouLite?
YouLite is an attempt at making a lightweight YouTube browser, that I could use whilst playing games to prevent my Google Chrome from eating up all the resources and taking up too much RAM.

#What do you hope to add?
I hope to add a YouTube browser so you can get videos directly from their API, removing the need to use chrome itself to get the video URLS. I also want to remove the PHP helper and implement the code directly into C#. I tried to do this but there's a problem when running queries through WebClients, whereas the PHP helper uses cURL.
